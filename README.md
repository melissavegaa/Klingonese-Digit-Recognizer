# Isolated digit speech recognition using HMM and MFCC features.

This Python project was created to train HMM models which recognize isolated words. 

This package features:
 - MFCC feature extraction
 - A script to record test audio. Output is saved to the test_data directory and is used to evaluate trained models
 - Model evaluation
 - Ease of use

###Note: This package was developed and tested using Python version 3.8

## Example: "Fruit Name Recognition"

- Train model using [train_hmm_fruits.py] - Just execute this script for training and testing
